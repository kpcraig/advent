# Advent of Code 2021
Doing it alphabetically again, but this time one language per day - having to resolve the same problem twice each day was just too much mental load.

While I'd like to do a new letter every day, it's slim pickings down the alphabet.

Also, this is going to get real annoying when I have to write a high 20s advent problem in _Verilog_ or something.
