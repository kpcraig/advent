# Polyglot [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)

To mix it up, I'm using a different language for every part, so 50 different languages in total. As
you might be able to tell from the beginning, I tried to do this mostly alphabetically.

* Day 1: Aargh!, Ada
* Day 2: AWK, BASIC
* Day 3: Befu---

*Okay, emergency modification, deferring esolangs for special occasions*
* Day 3: C, C++
* Day 4: C-Sharp, Clojure
* Day 5: COBOL, Coffeescript
* Day 6: D, Dart

Contributions are welcomed for any problem already solved, especially for code elegance fixes. I
apologize for being a couple days behind; finding 50 different languages requires something of a deep
dive into programming language history sometimes.
