# Advent of Code 2022

So the alphabet thing got pretty old and honestly quite tiring. So this year I've picked my top N best languages
and will rotate through them 1 per day.

Somewhat arbitrarily, I have picked:
- C
- C++
- Go
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust

This gets us through 24 days, and I roughly have the plan to do some weird wildcard language at the end.
