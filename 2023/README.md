This is the 2023 version of my overly laborious and difficult to complete advent of code personal challenge.

For this year, I asked ChatGPT for 25 programming languages. Then I asked (several times) for replacements
because some of them were repeats or not full languages. Then, since AoC problems tend to escalate, I sorted
them by reverse TIOBE order, to more or less put the more popular languages at the end.
